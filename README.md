### Description:
This application uses the Clarifai API and its image analysis & tag generation. It sorts images in local storage on the user's computer based on the top tag generated by the Clarifai system and then generates and organizes them to corresponding folders based on their tag. Simply, this application is a photo organization application. This is particularly useful for large libraries of images.
