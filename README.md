//App Name: PhoTag

//Description: This application uses the Clarifai API and its image analysis & tag generation. It
  sorts images in local storage on the user's computer based on the top tag generated by the Clarifai
  system and then generates and moves them to corresponding folders based on their tag. Simply, this 
  application is a photo organization application. This is particularly useful for large libraries of images.
